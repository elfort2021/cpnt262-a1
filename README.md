Originally started with Hamburger menu that toggles between open and closed.
Realized I had only used query selectors and none of the document events or the required input for the assignment .
always a classic move.
starting over Friday 11:16 am! Here we go. all the code from the hb menu is in my github though- i'll go back and look at it to try and figure out why I went so wrong. Also my foreach function presented two different loop options and I couldnt understand the first one, more hw.
Toggle b/w light and dark complete. Also an accurate rep if it got stuck on the terrified side forever 

Switcing to Dark-lightmode toggle to reflect how JS is going for me day to day-
