# cpnt262-a1



Originally started with Hamburger menu that toggles between open and closed. 
Realized I had only used query selectors and none of the document events or the required input for the assignment . 
always a classic move. 
starting over Friday 11:16 am! Here we go. all the code from the hb menu is in my github though- i'll go back and look at it to try and figure out why I went so wrong. Also my foreach function presented two different loop options and I couldnt understand the first one, more hw 



Switcing to Dark-lightmode toggle.
